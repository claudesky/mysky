In continuing learning NeoVim, the thought crossed my mind that EMACS might possibly be the better way to go.
Reading a few reddit posts, it seems I just have FOMO - and I should get it out of my head and stick to nvim.
Still.. I remember tsoding uses EMACS - and the way he does is pretty cool.
I don't think I will like elisp, lua rocks, nvim it is.

This is the way to use neovim again here

Learning about vim Buffers, Windows, and Tabs. Also doing my best to keep my fingers on the home row.

Installed the Vimium extension on Chrome to be able to use vim-like motions to browse the web.

There were a few interesting articles on Qiita - I read about the CCNF Landscape's *Continuous Optimization*. Will come back to the article another day.

While looking for ways to improve my Vimium experience from yesterday - I watched a video about Qutebrowser and decided to switch. It's going great so far! There's better support for vim motions, and a lot of Google gunk has been removed (the browser is based on Chromium).

Going back to tmux has also been fun. For now, I'm stuck searching up every key binding - but even that is a pleasant experience with Qute.
