# 令和七年八月八日（金）

In continuing learning NeoVim, the thought crossed my mind that EMACS might possibly be the better way to go.
Reading a few reddit posts, it seems I just have FOMO - and I should get it out of my head and stick to nvim.
Still.. I remember tsoding uses EMACS - and the way he does is pretty cool.
I don't think I will like elisp, lua rocks, nvim it is.
