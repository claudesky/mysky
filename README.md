# MySky

A Project where I don't know where it'll end up.
どこまでか、何かなるのか分からないプロジェクト。

## Vision

I want to create program where you can manage virtual networks (SD-WAN-like) with a web-like interface.

---

### Frontend/UI

Will probably use something like Vue or maybe even Svelte or plain JS for the frontend. Running on something like electron?
Sad that I might have to use Electron, as it's quite heavy. But then the alternative seems to be learning GTK - no thanks (I think?)!

### Backend

Probably Go for the http layer, but C for what communicates with the system. Maybe bash? Sounds fun.

---

## Process

The resulting software will just be a coincidence of what I really want to do: learn;

* C
* TAP/TUN Interfaces (Not sure which one I need yet)
* More Go
* NeoVim
* Get better at the terminal (ThePrimagen/Tsoding levels)

I would like to write the entirety of this in NeoVim. The first commit to this readme file will be in plain Vim. I am yet to read the NeoVim tutorial.

## Features

* Run containers in the veths
* Simulate bad network conditions and latency
* Packet sniffing and reports
* SD-WAN simulation!

## Journal

I will write a journal to log my thoughts in this repo.
